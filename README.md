## Project Topic: Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease

We chose this topic because chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a large and growing health problem. In 2023 it affected about **788 million adults (14% of all adults)**, more than double the 378 million in 1990, and it was the **ninth leading cause of death**, with 1.48 million deaths ([GBD 2023, The Lancet, 2025](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41213283/)). Most of these cases are at an early stage, where the disease is often silent but can still be slowed. Since it can be detected with routine blood and urine tests, predicting a patient's risk level from this data is a practical way to support earlier diagnosis.

## Research Objectives
- Compare at least three classic models (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, kNN, Random Forest) to find which predicts the 5 CKD risk levels best, using macro-F1 (R3).
- Identify the clinical and lab features that contribute most to the prediction, using feature selection and model feature importance (R2).
- Build and tune an MLP neural network and compare it with the best classic model on the same test data (R4).

## Datasets
We compared four kidney disease datasets and chose **Dataset 2, the [Kidney Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanik000/kidney-disease-dataset)** from Kaggle.

It is a large multi-class dataset (20,538 patients, 5 risk levels), with no missing values or duplicates. It also has the richest features (42), and is the only one combining eGFR, advanced biomarkers, lifestyle and family history. It is more widely used than the closest alternative, Dataset 3 (48 vs 28 Kaggle votes).

<summary>Dataset 2 details: source, license and two example rows</summary>

- **Source:** [Kaggle (amanik000)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanik000/kidney-disease-dataset). Origin not stated; the first 24 columns match the [UCI CKD dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/336/chronic+kidney+disease) (Rubini et al., 2015), so it appears to be an extended version of it.
- **License:** "Unknown" on Kaggle; the UCI source is CC BY 4.0.
- **Class balance:** No Disease 80%, Low 10%, Moderate 4%, High 4%, Severe 2%.
- **Extra data collected:** none.

| Age | BP | Creatinine | eGFR | Hemoglobin | Hypertension | Diabetes | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 54 | 167 | 7.55 | 71.62 | 11.8 | yes | yes | No_Disease |
| 89 | 128 | 8.31 | 117.70 | 13.3 | no | yes | Severe_Disease |
